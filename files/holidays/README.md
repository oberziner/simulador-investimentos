This folder contains a .xls file with the list of holidays used by the banking system in Brazil.

Source: https://www.anbima.com.br/feriados/feriados.asp

It also contains a messy script that converts this file to a JSON with the list of holidays (removing the weekday and the holiday name)

PS: npm i xls-to-json is needed to execute the script
